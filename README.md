ðŸ§® Scientific Calculator

A fully-featured scientific calculator built with Python and PyQt5. It supports standard arithmetic operations, advanced scientific functions, memory operations, and a sleek modern interface. Perfect for daily calculations or learning scientific math functions.

âœ¨ Features

Standard arithmetic: +, -, *, /

Scientific functions: sin, cos, tan, log, ln, âˆš, xÂ², xÊ¸, 1/x, factorial (!)

Mathematical constants: Ï€ and e

Memory functions: MC, MR, M+, M-, MS

Entry management: C (clear all), CE (clear entry), âŒ« (backspace), Â± (change sign)

Parentheses support for grouping

Expression display for real-time feedback

Keyboard input support

Error handling (division by zero, invalid inputs)

Dark modern GUI with hover and press effects

A sleek, modern calculator interface built with PyQt5.

ðŸš€ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/11Siya05/PyQt-Scientific-Calculator
cd PyQt-Scientific-Calculator


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install PyQt5

ðŸŽ® Usage

Run the calculator:

python main.py


Use the buttons or your keyboard to perform calculations.

Examples:

sin(30) â†’ press 3, 0, then sin, then =

5^3 â†’ press 5, xÊ¸, 3, =

Store in memory â†’ press MS

Recall memory â†’ press MR

ðŸ’¡ How It Works

Display management: Shows current input and full expression

Operations: Handles basic arithmetic, repeated = calculations, and error handling

Scientific functions: Uses Python math module with input validation

Memory: Stores a single numeric value with M+, M-, MS, MR, MC

UI: Built with PyQt5, uses QGridLayout for buttons and QLineEdit for display
